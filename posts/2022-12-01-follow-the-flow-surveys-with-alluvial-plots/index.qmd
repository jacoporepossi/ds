As per [last year](https://jacoporepossi.github.io/learningq/kaggle/competitions/data%20visualization/data%20science/2021/11/28/citizen-data-scientists-the-role-of-auto-ml-tools.html), I took part to the [Kaggle's annual](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2022) Machine Learning and Data Science Survey competition.

Although the goal of the analysis was the same, this time I decided to adopt a different approach, using only one chart type: Alluvial diagrams.

The work was complex but rewarding, as it was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of this type of visualization and the Plotly library. I was also humbled to have received [Honorable Mention](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2022/discussion/372587) for my work!
