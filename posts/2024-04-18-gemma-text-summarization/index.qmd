    Insights from the Kaggle Gemma text summarization competition, where I explored summarization techniques using Gemma and LangChain.

## Overview
The goal of [this competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-assistants-with-gemma) was to create a notebook that demonstrates how to use the Gemma LLM to accomplish one of the following data science oriented tasks:

- Explain or teach basic data science concepts.
- Answer common questions about the Python programming language.
- Summarize Kaggle solution write-ups.
- Explain or teach concepts from Kaggle competition solution write-ups.
- Answer common questions about the Kaggle platform.

My final choice was the complex world of text summarization using Gemma and LangChain. The key aspects I discuss are:

- Establishing a text summarization pipeline using Gemma and LangChain
- Providing an overview of the crucial parameters and methods one should keep in mind while working with an LLM
- Exploring summarization techniques, such as Stuffing, MapReduce and Refine
- Fine-tuning Gemma using Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)
- Future considerations and next steps

This work aims to build a comprehensive understanding of the task and develop a pipeline that can serve as a good starting point for individuals interested in approaching summarization tasks using open-source models like Gemma.
