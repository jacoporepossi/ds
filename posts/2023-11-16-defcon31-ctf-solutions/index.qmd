This is my second year that I participate in the DEFCON challenge, this year it was not during summer so I had the chance to put in more effort. \
It was fun and painful, as always, but I learned a lot along the way and secured the 75th place out of 1345 people (top 6%).

In this competition, we were presented with 27 hand-crafted machine learning security challenges to find flags, solve puzzles, and gain hands-on experience with concepts of AI security and safety.\
