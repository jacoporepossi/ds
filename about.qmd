Graduated in Materials Engineering & Nanotechnology at Politecnico of Milan, I have a Master's in Data Science for Economics, Business and Finance at University of Milan.

Passionate about technology and innovation, I currently work in Jakala as Senior Data Scientist in the Digital & Media Business Unit. My daily tasks are to analyze large-scale structured and unstructured data, performing deep-dive statistical analysis to address business objectives and clients' needs.
